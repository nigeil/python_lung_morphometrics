Installation
============

From sources
------------

The sources for python lung morphometrics can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/sylviamic/python_lung_morphometrics

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -U -e .

This will force a local user installation in 'editable mode',
meaning changes made to source files will propagate without the 
need for re-installation. Useful for debugging and prototyping 
new functionality.
